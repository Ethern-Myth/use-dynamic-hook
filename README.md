# `useDynamicHook`

**'useDynamicHook'** is not a standard React Hook provided by React itself; rather, it is a custom hook created by users to encapsulate dynamic behavior or logic in a reusable and flexible way. Here are some key differences between useDynamicHook and standard React hooks:

## Installation

```bash
npm install use-dynamic-hook --save
OR
yarn add use-dynamic-hook
OR
pnpm add use-dynamic-hook
```

## Purpose

**'useDynamicHook'** is a custom React hook designed to create dynamic hooks with customizable behavior within functional components. It encapsulates complex logic or behavior and provides a cleaner interface to components, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

<br/>

* Implementation:

    Standard React hooks are implemented and maintained by the React team and are part of the React library.
    useDynamicHook is a custom hook created by users. It is implemented by users according to their specific needs and requirements and is not part of the React library.

<br/>

* Usage:

    Standard React hooks are used directly within functional components to manage state and perform side effects.
    useDynamicHook is used similarly to standard React hooks but allows for more dynamic behavior and customization. It can be used to encapsulate complex logic or behavior and provide a cleaner interface to components.

<br/>

* Flexibility:

    Standard React hooks have predefined behavior and are used for specific purposes such as managing state or performing side effects.
    useDynamicHook provides more flexibility and can be tailored to various use cases by allowing users to define custom behavior or logic within the hook.

## Parameters

**hookFunction**: A function that defines the dynamic behavior of the hook.

<br/>

It takes two parameters:

<br/>

* **getState**: A function that returns the current state or value of the hook.

* **setState**: A function that updates the state or value of the hook.

* **props (optional)**: Additional props that can be passed to customize the behavior of the hook.

* **deps (optional)**: An array of dependencies that, when changed, will trigger the recalculation of the hook's behavior. If not provided, the hook will only be recalculated once when it is initially rendered.

## Return Value

The return value of useDynamicHook depends on the behavior defined by the hookFunction. It can vary based on the use case and customization provided by the user.

## Benefits

* **Flexibility**: **'useDynamicHook'** offers flexibility by allowing you to create custom hooks with dynamic behavior tailored to specific use cases.
* **Reusability**: Encapsulating complex logic within dynamic hooks promotes code reusability across multiple components.
* **Encapsulation**: Dynamic hooks encapsulate related logic within a single hook, keeping it organized and easier to manage.
* **Customization**: You can customize the behavior of dynamic hooks by passing different configurations or parameters, enabling them to adapt to various scenarios.
* **Optimization**: The hook memoizes the result of the dynamic hook function, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-execution when dependencies haven't changed.

The **useDynamicHook** custom hook can offer several performance benefits compared to using multiple instances of standard React hooks like useState or useEffect. Here are some potential performance benefits of using **useDynamicHook**:

<br/>

1. **Memoization**:
   * **useDynamicHook** can internally use **useMemo** to memoize the result of the dynamic hook function. This means that the hook function is only executed once when its dependencies change, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-execution.
<br/>

2. **Single Hook Instance**:
   * Instead of using multiple instances of standard React hooks (e.g., multiple **useState** or **useEffect** calls) to manage related state or side effects, useDynamicHook encapsulates all the logic within a single hook instance. This reduces the overhead of managing multiple hook instances and can improve performance.

<br/>

3. **Optimized Dependency Tracking**:

    * With useDynamicHook, you can specify dependencies that trigger recalculation of the hook's behavior when they change. This allows for optimized dependency tracking compared to using multiple independent hooks with potentially overlapping dependencies.
  
<br/>

4. **Customized Behavior**:

   * `useDynamicHook` allows for customizing the behavior of the hook based on specific requirements. By tailoring the hook's behavior to the exact needs of your component, you can avoid unnecessary computations or side effects, leading to better performance.

<br/>

5. **Reduced Render Cycles**:

   * By encapsulating related logic within a single hook instance, `useDynamicHook` can help reduce the number of render cycles in your components. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with complex state management or side effects that involve multiple interdependent variables.

<br/>

6. **Improved Code Organization**:
   * Using `useDynamicHook` promotes better code organization by encapsulating related logic within a single hook. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, which in turn can improve performance by making it easier to reason about and optimize.

<br/>

7. **Avoiding Closure Overheads**:
   * When using multiple instances of standard React hooks, each hook creates its own closure, which can lead to potential memory overhead. `useDynamicHook`, by encapsulating all logic within a single hook instance, avoids unnecessary closure creation, potentially reducing memory usage and improving performance.

<br/>

Overall, `useDynamicHook` offers performance benefits by optimizing memoization, reducing render cycles, and improving code organization compared to using multiple instances of standard React hooks for complex logic or side effects within functional components

## Usage

```typescript
import useDynamicHook from 'use-dynamic-hook';

function MyComponent() {
  // Define the hook behavior using hookFunction
  const myDynamicHook = useDynamicHook((getState, setState, props) => {
    // Define the dynamic behavior here
    // Use getState to access the current state or value
    // Use setState to update the state or value
    // Use props to customize the behavior if needed

    // Return the result of the dynamic behavior
    return result;
  }, [deps]);

  // Use myDynamicHook in your component as needed

  return (
    // JSX content
  );
}

```

## Example

Suppose we want to create a dynamic counter hook that increments the counter on each click:

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';
import useDynamicHook from 'use-dynamic-hook';

function useDynamicCounter(initialCount) {
  return useDynamicHook((getState, setState) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

    const increment = () => {
      setCount(count + 1);
    };

    return { count, increment };
  });
}

function CounterComponent() {
  const { count, increment } = useDynamicCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
